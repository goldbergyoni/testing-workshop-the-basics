// ✅ TASK: The weather service can't and shouldn't predict weather for the same day if it's before 3am (too late)
// Ensure that when the trip date is today before 3am, the response succeeded field is false
// 💡 TIP: Use Sinon fake timers to control the time: https://sinonjs.org/releases/latest/fake-timers/

// ✅ TASK: With regard to the test above (weather before 3 am), ensure to clean-up the fake timers between tests
// 💡 TIP: Use Sinon fake timers to control the time: https://sinonjs.org/releases/latest/fake-timers/

// ✅ TASK: The clip service is using the instructions validator  (instructions-validator.js) to validate the input.
// Stub the validator to return validation failure with reason 'no-photos', ensure that the generateClip response is not succeeded and it includes the reason
// 💡 TIP: You might struggle a bit to stub the validator, why? Hint: see how the the 'trip-clip-service' imports the validator
// 💡 TIP: You may need to use 'jest.resetModules()'

test("When validations fails due to 'no photos', then the generate clip should return succeeded equals false", () => {});
